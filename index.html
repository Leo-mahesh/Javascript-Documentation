          <p>
            JavaScript
            ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged
            dynamic programming language
            that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by
            Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla
            Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation)
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more
            experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D
            graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible.
            Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core
            JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with
            minimum effort. These include
          </p>

          <p>
            Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web
            browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating
            HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video
            stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio
            samples.
          </p>

          <p>
            Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate
            functionality in sites from other content providers, such as
            Twitter or Facebook.
          </p>

          <p>
            Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to
            accelerate the work of building sites and applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to
            JavaScript—to present the details of how the core JavaScript
            language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn
            more in MDN's JavaScript learning area, as well as in other parts
            of MDN.
          </p>
          <p>
            The section below introduces some aspects of the core language and
            offers an opportunity to play with a few browser API features too.
            Have fun!

            JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As
            your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will enter a new
            dimension of power and creativity.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging
            than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start
            small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add
            JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example.
            (Hello world! is the standard for introductory programming
            examples.)
          </p>
              <p>
                Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts.
                Within the scripts folder, create a new file called main.js,
                and save it. In your index.html file
              </p>

              <p>
                This is doing the same job as the
                <link /> element for CSS. It
                applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect
                on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the
                page).
              </p>
              <p>
                Add this code to the main.js file:
                <pre>
                <code>
              const myHeading = 
              document.querySelector('h1');
              myHeading.textContent = 
              'Hello world!';</code></pre>
              </p>
              <p>
                Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load
                index.html in your browser. You should see something like
                this:
              </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
          <header>
            <h1>Variables</h1>
          </header>
          <li>
            Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring
            a variable with the var (less recommended, dive deeper for the
            explanation) or the let keyword, followed by the name you give to
            the variable:
          </li>
          <pre>
          <code>
          let myVariable;
        </code></pre>
          <li>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:</li>
          <pre><code>
          myVariable = 'Bob';
        </code></pre>
          <li>Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:</li>
          <pre><code>
          let myVariable = 'Bob';
        </code></pre>
          <li>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:</li>
          <pre><code>
          myVariable;
        </code></pre>
          <li>
            After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in
            the code:
          </li>
          <pre><code>
          let myVariable = 'Bob'; myVariable = 'Steve';</code></pre>
          <li>
            Note that variables may hold values that have different data
            types:
          </li>
          <table class="table">
            <thead>
              <tr>

                <td>
                  This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify
                  that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote
                  marks.
                </td>
                <td><code>let myVariable = 'Bob';</code></td>

                </th>
                <td>
                  This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.

                  This is a True/False value. The words <code>true</code> and
                  <code>false</code> are special keywords that don't need
                  quote marks.
                </td>
                <td><code>let myVariable = true;</code></td>

                <td>
                  This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values
                  in a single reference.

                <td>
                  <code>let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];</code><br />
                  Refer to each member of the array like this:<br />
                  <code>myVariable[0]</code>, <code>myVariable[1]</code>, etc.
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>

                  Object
                </th>
                <td>
                  This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object
                  and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you
                  learn.
                </td>
                <td>
                  <code>let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');</code><br />
                  All of the above examples too.
                </td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            So why do we need variables? Variables are necessary to do
            anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change,
            then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting
            message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.

            <h1>Comments</h1>
          </header>
          <p>
            Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code.
            The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write
            comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:
          </p>
          <pre>
              <code>
                /*
                Everything in between is a comment.
                */
              </code>
            </pre>
          <p>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:</p>
         <pre><code>
          //Everything in between is a comment.
          </code></pre>
          </pre>

          <header>
            <h1>Operators</h1>
          </header>
          <p>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the
            following table, you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try in the
            JavaScript console.</p>

                <td>This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a <code>true</code> into a
                  <code>false</code>, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests
                  whether two values are <em>not</em> equal.
                </td>
                <td><code>!</code>, <code>!==</code></td>
                <td>
                  <p>For "Not", the basic expression is <code>true</code>, but the comparison returns <code>false</code>

                            !(myVariable === 3);</code></p>

                  <p>"Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with different syntax. Here we are testing "is
                    <code>myVariable</code> NOT equal to 3". This returns<code> false</code> because
                    <code>myVariable</code> IS equal to 3:
                  </p>

                  <p><code>let <code>myVariable = 3;</code><br>

        <section class="main-section" id="Conditionals">
          <header>
            <h1>Conditionals</h1>
          </header>
          <p>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of
            conditionals is the if ... else statement. For example:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
          let iceCream = 'chocolate';
          if(iceCream === 'chocolate') {
          alert('Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!');
          } else {
          alert('Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...');
          }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>The expression inside the if( ... ) is the test. This uses the identity operator (as described above) to
            compare the variable iceCream with the string chocolate to see if the two are equal. If this comparison
            returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of code—after
            the else statement—runs instead.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
          <header>
            <h1>Functions</h1>
          </header>
          <p>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of
            code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to
            repeatedly writing the same code. You have already seen some uses of functions previously. For example:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
            let myVariable = 
            document.querySelector('h1');}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <pre>
            <code>
            alert('hello!');}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>These functions, document.querySelector and alert, are built into the browser.</p>
          <p>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses— () —it is likely a
            function. Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the
            parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</p>
          <p>For example, the alert() function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give
            it a string as an argument to tell the function what message to display.</p>
          <p>You can also define your own functions. In the next example, we create a simple function which takes two
            numbers as arguments and multiplies them:</p>
          <pre>
          <code>
          function multiply(num1,num2) 
          {let result = num1 * num2;return result;}
          </code>
        </pre>
          <p>Try running this in the console; then test with several arguments. For example:</p>
          <pre>
          <code>multiply(4, 7);
          multiply(20, 20);
          multiply(0.5, 3);
          </code>
        </pre>



        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Events">
          <header>
            <h1>Events</h1>
          </header>
          <p>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity
            in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is
            fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the following
            into your console, then click on the current webpage:</p>
          <pre><code>
          document.querySelector('html').onclick = 
          function() {
          alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');}
          </code></pre>
          <p>There are many ways to attach an event handler to an element. Here we select the <html> element, setting
            its onclick handler property equal to an anonymous (i.e. nameless) function, which contains the code we want
            the click event to run.</p>
          <p>Note that</p>
          <pre><code>
          document.querySelector('html').onclick = 
          function() {};
        </code></pre>
          <p>is equivalent to</p>
          <pre><code>
          let myHTML = 
          document.querySelector('html');
          myHTML.onclick = function() {};
          </code>
          </pre>
          <p>It's just shorter.</p>
